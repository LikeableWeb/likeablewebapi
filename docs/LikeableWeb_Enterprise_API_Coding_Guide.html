        1. Key Concepts</h3>
    <p />
    <p>
        LikeableWeb API is using the (REST) protocol.
        The goal of the API is to provide a very simple way for webbased clients to connecting to the LikeableWeb
		Enterprise API for exchanging data against different social medias.
		LikeableWeb aggregates information from various social media so that you as a developer only needs to consume data from one API.
		LikeableWeb also handles changes from the various social media.
		We have focused on the social media is the greatest and most important for the companies. Of course, there are many and we are open to add them afterwards as there is a need.
	</p>
	 <h3 id="2">
        2. Application Client and Secret</h3>
    <p />
    <p>
        The Application Client Identification and the Application Client Secret are used when authenticate against the LikeableWeb API and for the system to know which application the call is related to. Through the application that is linked to application-client a number of specified social media streams with its various news feeds can then be retreived through the API.
		<br/><br/>
		Note:
		
		An application thus contains a list of different social media streams. The application is tied to the account and an account can have multiple applications.
		
		Each application can have one or more clients that are used to connect to the application. Example of a client is a website that consume the LikeableWeb API and displays the news on the site.
	</p>
	<h3 id="3">
        3. Lets Get Started!</h3>
    <p>
        The easiest way to retrieve data from the LikeableWeb API is to create a instance of a rest-client 
		and then specifying the root path to the api service. 
		
		Then using the basic authentication by enter the Application Client Id as UserName and the Application Client
		Secret as the the Password. These data are obtained when setting up the Enterprise-account
		and the application.
	</p>
    <pre>
	// ...using a .NET rest client

	var client = new JsonServiceClient("http://demoapi.likeableweb.com/");
	client.UserName = "You app client id";	//For testing: DemoAppClient
	client.Password = "Your app client secret";  //For testing: demo15
    </pre>
    <p>
        Once the client instance has been created, the next thing to do is making the news feed request
		by sending an empty or 0-definied time-pointer to the service (StartTick).
	</p>
    <pre>
	var response = client.Send<NewsFeedResponse>(new NewsFeedRequest() { StartTick = 0 });
    </pre>
	<p>
        Since the service address changes in the various social media platforms, and that it is not allowed to retrieve all records via a single call, a time pointer must be included in the request from which data is to be retrieved.
		
		This is not something that you as a user need to track apart, since the service will answer from the API-call with the next ”time-pointer” or the StartTick. The value of this is not something that needs to be analyzed but have to be stored and handled by the client for the next API-call. If this value is not changed for the previous call, it means that the time pointer still remains on the same end date.  
		
		The time pointer is a date that is handled internally by LikableWeb and used to filter out the records when the posts last been updated.
	</p>
	<h3 id="4">
        4. The News Feed Data</h3>
    <p />
    <p>
        Data obtained from the LikeableWeb-Newsfeed Request is aggregated from the various social media platforms and contains a list of news feed objects. The News object is described last in this document in the reference list, see <a href="LikeableWebAPIEnterpriseGuideLines.html#r1">The News Feed Object</a>.
		Each object represents a news post on social media and may have one or more associated media objects for photography and video.
		
		For example, from Instagram the generated image will result in three different size-formats resulting in three different 
		photo-objects attached to the news feed object. On the main object, a specified property, "AttachedMediaType" indicating which objects are linked.
		</p>
    <pre>
	NewsFeed
		|-NewsFeedPhotos 
		|-NewsFeedVideos
	</pre>
    <p>
	The example below shows just how to iterate through the list of news objects and prints them in the application.
	</p>
	<pre>
	foreach (var newsFeed in response.NewsFeeds)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("----------------");
		Console.WriteLine("LikeableWebFeedId: " + newsFeed.LikeableWebFeedId);
		Console.WriteLine("PostId: " + newsFeed.PostId);

		Console.WriteLine("Caption: " + newsFeed.Caption);
		Console.WriteLine("Text: " + newsFeed.Text);
		Console.WriteLine("Tags: " + newsFeed.Tags);
	}
	</pre>
	<h3 id="r1">
        Ref 1. News Feed Object</h3>
    <p>
		The news feed object is the main object when subscribing to news feed data from the LikeableWeb service and the API.
